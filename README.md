## Questions

Q. Why use shush?
- There's no reason to, and there's no reason not to. It's a very small little project I made to mess around with Go, and I don't expect it to be used anywhere. If you do though, shoot me a dm on discord (@xendyex), I'd love to see it!

Q. Why is there no UI?
- This is mainly meant to be used as a backend, really. It's very very simple, and uhh yeah that's about it. Also I hate making UI.
